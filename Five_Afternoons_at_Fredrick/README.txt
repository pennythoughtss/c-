MY FINAL PROJECT IS "Five_Afternoons_at_Fredrick"
-----OPTIMIZED FOR WINDOWS ONLY-----
-> I'm not sure if it will break on other systems, but I sure haven't tried it



A tasty fnaf ripoff built in the terminal.

Run from "Program.cs" cus that's where all the juicy stuff coalesces.

press C to open the camera (drains power)
A and D to flip through the cameras

Q and E control the lights (drains power)
A and D control the doors (drains power FAST)

Keep the animatronics outside the office and survive til 6AM, but keep an eye on your
power! A blackout could be the end of you.


L to open dev stats (if you're BORING and feel like cheating)
