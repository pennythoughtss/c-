MY FINAL PROJECT IS "Five_Afternoons_at_Fredrick"

A tasty fnaf ripoff built in the terminal.

Run from "Program.cs" cus that's where all the juicy stuff coalesces.

press C to open the camera
Q and E control the lights
A and D control the doors

Keep the animatronics outside the office and survive til 6AM!!!
